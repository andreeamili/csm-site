      <div className='content-about align'>And even if you're not passionate about this sport or curious to experience what it's like to team
        up with a partner who doesn't speak the same language as you, you can always come and visit our horses who are waiting for
        you with open arms and hope that you'll bring them a reward for the hard work they put in for us every day.</div>
        <div className='content-about align'>
        These were just a few of our horses, graceful and powerful animals that delight our eyes and inspire our admiration.
         Whether they are used in equestrian sports, agriculture, or simply as pets, horses are truly special and deserve all our
          attention.
